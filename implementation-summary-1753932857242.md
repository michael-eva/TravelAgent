## Status
The implementation involves removing the 'app' directory while preserving the 'ui' directory and its contents. This includes updating any references or dependencies related to the 'app' directory in configuration files and build scripts to ensure the application continues to function correctly.

## Validation
1. Verify that the 'app' directory has been successfully removed from the project's file structure.
2. Ensure that the 'ui' directory and its contents are still accessible and functioning correctly.
3. Run the application and perform comprehensive testing to validate that the removal of the 'app' directory has not introduced any issues or regressions.
